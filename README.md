# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a project made with the help of Neural Network

In this project we will import a model using keras and create a model . That model will be used to identify the characters which will be written in a GUI created in python with the help of pygames.We will use the MNIST dataset for the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition. We are implementing it using various algorithms like Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Network. We will be building a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it.
